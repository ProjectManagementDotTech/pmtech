# Issues

## Priority High
* Cannot change project in previous timesheet entries (due to there being a
`timesheetEntry` prop and a `editorTimesheetEntry` data object)

## Priority Medium

## Priority Low
* Fix `UT000002_UserApiTests` rather wasteful method of retrieving the email
address

# Resolved
* Adding a project to an empty workspace does not update the view to show the
newly added project
* Adding a timesheet entry gives an Internal Server Error (500)
* Data logged to console in TimesheetReport
* Queues are not running in the environment
* There's a failed job in the corresponding table
* Timesheet entries from different workspaces show up in the timesheet entry
daily index
* "TypeError: el is null" in FilteringDropdownControl.vue onInput
